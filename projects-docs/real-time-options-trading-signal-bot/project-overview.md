### About project

I want to build a real-time trading signal system focused on options buying only (CE/PE) for Indian markets.

Requirements:

Live market data integration from TrueData API (or similar NSE/BSE/MCX feed)

Auto-scan all instruments (NSE, BSE, MCX) and generate Buy/Sell signals with Entry, Stoploss, and Targets

Focus only on Options Buying (Index Options, Stock Options, MCX Options)

Instant WhatsApp alerts (via WhatsApp Business API / Twilio / Gupshup)

Backend should be in Python (scalable for future upgrades)

Should support indices (Nifty, BankNifty, Finnifty), top F&O stocks, and MCX commodities (Gold, Silver, Crude, NG, etc.)

Basic dashboard (optional) to view live signals and trade history

Future upgrade possibility: integration with AngelOne / Dhan SmartAPI for auto-execution

Deliverables:

Working bot with live option signals

Whats-App alert system

Source code + setup guide
