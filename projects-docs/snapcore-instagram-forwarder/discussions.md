1. Detail about telegram notifications, I guess it is not in the existing python script
2. proxy management, ask whether we are going to use the open-sources proxy or any premium proxy
3. regarding the content storage, we are going to use sd3 or local sever storage
4. about  connections
5. worker queue management
6. Regarding the web-socket connection
7. time-line and payment

Now we have to create the **Functional Specification Document (FSD)** for the client  with example. 
we are going to implement 
from login connection management etc.. what are things mentioned in the project requirements every things included in this user docs  
include every things from scratch with example
create only document

Here are some **great YouTube search keywords** you can use to discover **interesting and engaging videos** based on the themes you mentioned — but with a twist so they’re not boring 👇

YouTube  to Instagram

- Account management includes storing the credentials
	- Accounts using  pydantic models 
- Download the video from youtube, find the good strategy to store the video
- Worker queue management
- Upload the video in instagram

To do:
 
- [x] create the youtube account & instagram account
- [ ] Find the reference and go through the docs






I do not know whether i understand the things wrongly or you understand them wrongly

No our script for the automation is working like 

if run the script and login with email id (USER), video uploads to that email only.

but I need like i want a script t[[]]hat will upload videos to  channels using the channel id and api key

let say there is youtube channel name paalpachai, He need upload the video to the youtube his youtube channel




Flow of the Instagram to YouTube  pipeline
- Request to end points 
-  Scrape all the contents from youtube(shorts)
- video quality control and improvisation
- upload it to the instagram 


YouTube URL → Download → Apply Overlays → Upload to Catbox → Post to Social Media → Delete Local File
    

things to consider is 
how can i store the video, local storage is fixed, but how can we handle it efficiently store it and upload it then delete it


now we need do the first part which is nothing but download the video and and upload it 

but the main thing we are going to do is using the celery and redis 
show the queue manaement
 process of the pipe line like downloded dowloding , processing , pending uploaded



 hey now have to the pipeline processing on  
  
pipeline is  
YouTube (we have only client secrets) → Download → Apply Overlays → Upload to Catbox → Post to Social Media → Delete Local File  
but the main things we are going to do is implement celery  
we can split this into different phases
