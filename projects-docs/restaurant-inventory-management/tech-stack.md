# Tech Stack

---

## 1. Frontend (Client Layer)

- Framework: React.js (fast, modular, perfect for dashboards)      
- UI Library: Material UI / Tailwind CSS (modern, responsive design)  
- State Management: Redux Toolkit or React Query (for API calls & caching)      
- Visualization: D3.js or Recharts (for analytics dashboards)  

---

## 2. API Gateway

- Nginx / Kong / AWS API Gateway [ needs to finalised later ]  
- Role: Request routing, JWT validation, rate limiting, logging.  

---

## 3. Authentication & Security

- Auth Service: Custom Auth microservice  Spring Boot
- JWT Tokens: RS256 asymmetric signing (for security in microservices)  
- RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) → enforced via JWT claims  
---

## 4. Backend Microservices

Each microservice will be modular, API-first, and independently deployable.

- Language & Framework:      
- Java (Spring Boot) → stable, enterprise-ready  
- Inventory Service: CRUD for stock, wastage tracking, supplier integration  
- Analytics Service: ML models, trend forecasting, waste reduction prediction  
- Notification Service: Event-driven (Kafka or RabbitMQ), sending email/SMS/in-app alerts  

---

## 5. Database Layer (Shared Schema)

- Primary DB: PostgreSQL 
- Caching: Redis (for session caching, frequently accessed queries) 
- Search: Elasticsearch (if you need fast searching across SKUs, menus, etc.)  

---

## 6. Analytics & Prediction

- ETL / Data Pipeline: Apache Kafka or Debezium for capturing events  
- Data Warehouse (optional): Snowflake / BigQuery / PostgreSQL OLAP partitioning  
- ML Models:  
- Python (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Prophet for demand forecasting)  
- Packaged as a microservice (e.g., Flask/FastAPI or Java ML lib)

---

## 8. CI/CD & DevOps

- Containerization: Docker  

- Orchestration: Kubernetes (K8s)  

- CI/CD Pipeline: GitHub Actions  



the project we are going to work is inventory management as core 
and all type of tracking like stocks, and advanced analytics,

Order management  like kios.
order management is two types manual by server, using our saas app

Inventory management with all type of tracking
advanced analytics

and it is as saas product 

this is the above tech stacks we have used 


you have design the project timeline as csv file 
like milestones 

three months 

i am going to work for three hours per day
