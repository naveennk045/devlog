### About project


Restaurants face inefficient inventory management due to a lack of predictive analytics, limited integrations, and poor scalability of existing systems. This results in food waste, stockouts, and increased operational costs.

### Examples:

1. Food waste – A café orders 50 kg of tomatoes weekly, but demand drops during the monsoon season. Without forecasting, 20% spoils.  

2. Stockouts – A QSR outlet runs out of burger buns during a weekend rush because supplier lead times weren’t factored into reorder planning.  

3. Poor integration – A restaurant uses one system for POS, another for inventory, and manual spreadsheets for supplier orders — leading to mismatched data.    

4. Scalability issues – A cloud kitchen expanding from 2 to 10 outlets struggles because its current POS inventory module can’t support multi-outlet procurement and central kitchen distribution.
