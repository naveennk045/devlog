# High-Level Design – Restaurant Inventory Management SaaS

---

## 1. Architecture Overview

The system is a multi-tenant SaaS with modular microservices and a shared-schema database. Each request passes through the API Gateway, which validates authentication and tenant identity using JWT. Microservices handle domain-specific logic (Inventory, Analytics, Ordering, etc.), and all database queries are scoped by tenant_id for isolation.

## 2. Core Components

### 1. API Gateway

- Entry point for all external requests.  
- Validates JWT (signature, expiry, tenant_id, roles).  
- Routes request to the correct microservice.  
- Applies rate limiting, logging, and monitoring.  
### 2. Auth Service

- Handles user login, tenant registration, and role-based access control.  
- Issues JWT tokens containing tenant_id, user_id, and roles.  
- Supports refresh tokens for session management.  

### 3. Inventory Service (Core)

- Manages stock, reorder levels, purchase orders, and wastage tracking.  
- Ensures all queries use tenant_id for tenant isolation.  
- Supports central kitchen + multiple outlet inventory sync.  
### 4. Analytics & Prediction Service (Core)

- Collects transactional + inventory data for each tenant.      
- Uses ML models to predict demand, optimize procurement, and reduce waste.  
- Generates dashboards for real-time insights.  
### 5. Order & POS Service (Optional/Integrations)
- Connects to POS systems, delivery apps, and supplier systems.  
- Syncs sales data with inventory for auto-adjustments.      
### 6. Notification/Alert Service
- Sends low-stock alerts, wastage alerts, and predictive suggestions.  
- Supports Email, SMS, and in-app notifications.  
### 7. Database Layer (Shared Schema)

- Single logical database cluster with tenant_id in all critical tables.  
- Ensures tenant isolation via query filters (WHERE tenant_id = ?).  
- Supports indexing, caching, and row-level security (if needed).

## 3. High-Level Data Flow

1. Login → User logs in → Auth Service issues JWT with tenant_id.  
2. API Gateway → Validates JWT → routes request.      
3. Microservices → Process request (Inventory, Analytics, etc.).  
4. Database Access → Query filtered by tenant_id.      
5. Response → Data returned only for that tenant.  
6. Analytics Service → Aggregates data → predicts trends → pushes insights to dashboards.
