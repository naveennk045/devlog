Before we discussing RAG, we need to know why this framework comes into play,
what are problem it actually solves

Many LLMs are pre-trained, so the models are lacking at giving an accurate responses.
Accurate in the sense, they responses are factually incorrect, outdated information, irrelevant information, and lacking in domain specific knowledge

- Irrelevant response
- Hallucination
- Outdated Information
- Lack in domain specific knowledge

##### What is RAG

**RAG - Retrieval-Augmented Generation**
The name says everything, it is about how we feed the external data from multiple resources like databases, web-pages, APIs or document hubs to LLM to improve the performance and accuracy of the LLMs
