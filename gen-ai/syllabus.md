### Guiding Philosophy: Learn by Doing
Theory is crucial, but you must apply it. For every concept you learn, implement it. Use datasets from places like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/).

### Key Mindset for Success

*   **Curiosity & Persistence:** You will get stuck. Debugging is a core skill.
*   **Mathematical Intuition:** Don't just use libraries; understand *why* an algorithm works.
*   **Communication:** Being able to explain your model's results to a non-technical audience is as important as building it.
