## 1. Core OOP Concepts (Foundation)

Understand theory, then apply with Java examples.

| Concept       | What to Learn         | Real-Life Analogy                          | Java Code Example                   |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Class         | Blueprint for objects | House blueprint                            | class Car { }                       |
| Object        | Instance of class     | A specific house                           | Car c = new Car();                  |
| Abstraction   | Hide internal details | Driving a car without knowing engine parts | abstract class Shape {}             |
| Encapsulation | Bind data + methods   | Medical capsule                            | Private fields with getters/setters |
| Inheritance   | Reuse parent class    | Son inherits traits from father            | class Dog extends Animal {}         |
| Polymorphism  | Many forms            | Person as father, employee, friend         | Method overriding / overloading     |

---

## 2. Types of Polymorphism


| Type         | Description        | Java Example                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Compile-Time | Method Overloading | add(int a, int b) vs add(double a, double b) |
| Runtime      | Method Overriding  | Dog extends Animal → override speak() method |

---

## 3. Access Modifiers (Visibility Control)

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Modifier|Scope|
|private|Class only|
|default|Package only|
|protected|Package + subclasses|
|public|Everywhere|

---

## 4. Advanced OOP Concepts


| Concept                 | Why It Matters            | Example / Learn                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Composition             | Stronger than inheritance | A Library has-a Book             |
| Association             | Loose connection          | A Student uses a Library         |
| Aggregation             | Weak has-a                | Department has Professors        |
| Dependency Injection    | Loosely coupled objects   | Spring @Autowired                |
| Interfaces              | Define contracts          | interface Payment {}             |
| Abstract Classes        | Partial implementation    | abstract class Vehicle {}        |
| Constructor Overloading | Flexible object creation  | Multiple constructors in a class |

---

## 5. SOLID Principles (Best Practices in OOP)


| Principle                 | Meaning                                     | Example                            |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| S - Single Responsibility | Class should do one thing                   | InvoicePrinter, not InvoiceManager |
| O - Open/Closed           | Open for extension, closed for modification | Use interfaces                     |
| L - Liskov Substitution   | Subclass should replace base class          | Bird → Sparrow can fly             |
| I - Interface Segregation | Small interfaces > big ones                 | Separate Readable, Writable        |
| D - Dependency Inversion  | Depend on abstractions, not implementations | Use interfaces and DI              |

---

## 6. Design Patterns (Real Power of OOP)

| Pattern Type | Examples                      |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Creational   | Singleton, Factory, Builder   |
| Structural   | Adapter, Decorator, Composite |
| Behavioral   | Strategy, Observer, State     |

You will implement these when building real-world applications using frameworks like Spring, Django, etc.

## 7. Common OOP Mistakes to Avoid

- Overusing inheritance instead of composition  
- Violating the Single Responsibility Principle (doing too much in one class)  
- Ignoring access modifiers (making everything public)  
- Creating tight coupling (classes depending too much on each other)  

| Feature                     | Interface                                                                                               | Abstract Class                                                                                 |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Definition                  | A contract that defines a set of methods that a class must implement.                                   | A partially implemented class that can have abstract methods and concrete methods.             |
| Purpose                     | Defines what a class can do (capabilities/behavior).                                                    | Defines what a class is (structure + some shared behavior).                                    |
| Methods                     | By default, all methods are abstract (Java < 8). From Java 8+, can have default and static methods.     | Can have both abstract methods (without body) and concrete methods (with implementation).      |
| Fields / Variables          | Only public static final constants.                                                                     | Can have instance variables with any access modifier.                                          |
| Multiple Inheritance        | A class can implement multiple interfaces.                                                              | A class can extend only one abstract class.                                                    |
| Constructor                 | Cannot have constructors.                                                                               | Can have constructors, used by subclasses.                                                     |
| Access Modifiers            | Methods are implicitly public (cannot be protected or private in Java < 9).                             | Abstract and concrete methods can have any access modifier (private, protected, public).       |
| Code Reusability            | Minimal (only default/static methods).                                                                  | High, can provide shared code to subclasses.                                                   |
| State / Fields              | Cannot maintain state (only constants).                                                                 | Can maintain state via instance variables.                                                     |
| When to Use                 | When multiple unrelated classes share a capability/behavior.                                            | When creating a common base class for related classes to reuse code.                           |
| Example Use Case            | Runnable, Serializable, Payable interface.                                                              | Vehicle abstract class with start() method implemented and move() abstract.                    |
| Extensibility / Flexibility | More flexible: multiple inheritance of behavior.                                                        | Less flexible due to single inheritance.                                                       |
| Breaking Changes            | Adding a new method in older versions can break implementing classes unless the default method is used. | Adding new abstract methods will force subclasses to implement, can break existing subclasses. |
| Performance                 | Minimal overhead, mostly design-oriented.                                                               | Slightly heavier due to object hierarchy, but generally negligible.                            |
| Java Version Features       | Java 8+: default and static methods; Java 9+: private methods allowed.                                  | Standard OOP, all versions support abstract class.                                             |
