**Introduction to Operating System

  

Operating System : 

  

- It is system software act  as intermediary between both Hardware and users 
    
-        Abstraction : 
    

- Hides the hardware complexities and allows the users to operate the system smoothly.
    

-         Arbitration : 
    

- It is about managing the multiple processes fairly in the system by allowing the shared hardware resources.
    

  

Abstraction = what user sees instead of raw hardware

Arbitration = fair distribution of limited resources
