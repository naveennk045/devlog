#### 1. Kotlin Fundamentals (The "Syntax" Layer)

You don't need to be a Kotlin expert to start, but you must understand how it differs from Java. Spend a day or two on these concepts.

- **Null Safety:** This is Kotlin's killer feature. Understand the difference between nullable (`String?`) and non-nullable (`String`) types, and how to safely handle them with `?.` (safe call operator), `?:` (elvis operator), and `!!.` (the "I know what I'm doing" operator—use sparingly!).
