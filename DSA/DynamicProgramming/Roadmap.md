## **Core Concepts & Subtopics**

### **Must-Learn Fundamentals**
Dynamic Programming (DP) is an algorithmic optimization technique that solves complex problems by breaking them into smaller subproblems and storing solutions to avoid redundant calculations. The core foundation requires understanding two essential properties:[1][2]

**Overlapping Subproblems**: Problems that can be broken down into smaller subproblems that are solved repeatedly. For example, computing Fibonacci numbers involves calculating the same values multiple times in a naive recursive approach.[3][1]

**Optimal Substructure**: The optimal solution to a problem can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems. This means the global optimum depends on local optima of subproblems.[2][1]

### **Core Techniques & Dependencies**
**Prerequisites** (Learn First):
- Solid understanding of recursion and recursion stack[4]
- Basic programming concepts: arrays, functions, loops[4]
- Mathematical foundations: combinatorics, probability theory[5]

**Primary Techniques**:
1. **Memoization (Top-Down)**: Recursive approach with caching to store subproblem results[6][1][3]
2. **Tabulation (Bottom-Up)**: Iterative approach building solutions from base cases upward[1][3][6]
3. **Space Optimization**: Reducing memory complexity by storing only necessary previous states[6]

### **Advanced Areas & Patterns**
**Common DP Patterns**:[7][8]
- **Linear DP**: Fibonacci sequence, Climbing Stairs, House Robber
- **Grid DP**: Unique Paths, Minimum Path Sum, Maximal Square[9]
- **Knapsack Variants**: 0/1 Knapsack, Unbounded Knapsack, Partition problems[9]
- **String DP**: Longest Common Subsequence, Edit Distance, Palindrome problems
- **Tree DP**: Maximum path sum, diameter of binary tree
- **Bitmask DP**: Traveling Salesman Problem, subset enumeration[9]
- **Interval DP**: Matrix Chain Multiplication, Palindrome Partitioning
