### **Binary Search Trees: The Critical Need for Balancing**

#### **Core Concept: The Promise vs. The Problem**

*   **The Promise (The "Why")**: The primary advantage of using a Binary Search Tree (BST) is to perform search, insertion, and deletion operations in **O(log N)** time complexity. This efficiency stems from the tree's hierarchical structure, which allows it to halve the search space at each step.

*   **The Problem (The "Catch")**: This logarithmic time complexity is **entirely dependent on the tree being balanced**. A balanced tree has a height close to logâ‚‚(N).

*   **The Worst-Case Scenario**: If elements are inserted in sorted order (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), the tree degenerates into a **linear linked list**.

    ```
    1
     \
      2
       \
        3
         \
          4
           \
            5
    ```
    *   **Height**: O(N)
    *   **Operation Complexity**: O(N)
    *   **Result**: The tree loses its main advantage, and performance becomes as slow as a simple list.

#### **The Solution: Self-Balancing Binary Search Trees**

To guarantee O(log N) performance, we use trees that **automatically reorganize** themselves during insertions and deletions to maintain a balanced state.

##### **1. AVL Trees**
*   **Balancing Strategy**: Strict height balancing. For any node, the heights of the left and right subtrees **differ by at most 1**.
*   **Mechanism**: Uses **rotations** (Left, Right, Left-Right, Right-Left) to fix balance after updates.
*   **Pros**: Provides the fastest lookups due to strict balance. Ideal for scenarios where search is the most frequent operation.
*   **Cons**: Requires more overhead during insertions and deletions to maintain strict balance, which can make these operations slightly slower.

**Visualization (Right Rotation for Left-Left Case)**:
