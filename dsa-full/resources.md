First of all the websites, I followed:

[LeetCode](http://www.leetcode.com/) — Best website for practicing DSA questions, good user interface, the discussion section is awesome :)

[GeeksforGeeks](http://www.geeksforgeeks.com/) — Treasure for the Computer Science students, one can get all the questions with their possible solutions and can also practice here.

[Techie Delight](https://www.techiedelight.com/) — A simplistic website made only for learning DSA.

Rest other websites to which you can refer are InterviewBit & [Educative.io](http://educative.io/).

Here is the sheet of a few selected DSA problems made by [Striver (take U forward)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJskGeByzRRSvmOyZOz61ig) and [**Love Babbar](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQHLxxBFrbfdrk1jF0moTpw).** Basically, these sheets will help you solve some selected problems which will highly increase your DSA skills and you have to understand the concepts, intuition, and logic that why we have applied the particular data structure or algorithm in this question, don’t cram anything:-

- Striver’s sheet contains 180 questions, which can be completed in 2–3 months at a normal pace, but if you know the basics of DSA then one can complete the sheet in 1 month only. Link to the sheet and video — [*Striver’s sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SM92efk8oDl8nyVw8NHPnbGexTS9W-1gmTEYfEurLWQ/edit), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNtzUR_MwUQ&ab_channel=takeUforward)*.
- Love’s sheet contains 450 questions, which can be completed in 5–6 months, and 3–4 months for one who knows the basics. Link to the sheet — [*Love’s sheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FMdN_OCfOI0iAeDlqswCiC2DZzD4nPsb/view), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iFALQ1ACdA&ab_channel=LoveBabbar)*. A very good tracking website is built i.e. [450DSA](http://450dsa.com/), which can help you to track these questions.

If you have less time left for interviews go for Striver’s sheet, but if you have enough time start solving Love’s sheet. Both the sheets are really awesome and amazing.

_Now the resources for each topic in DSA, and resources will be mostly the videos present on Youtube, and once you are done with the videos start practicing that topic, and do a good amount of questions on that topic, so that you get to know about that topic in-depth and you can completely understand it._

1. Arrays — The very first and basic topic of DSA.

Note: These are just resources, from where you can learn the topics but remember you have to practice a lot of questions on this topic to get a good command. And also don’t just stick to these resources only, explore more on Youtube.
