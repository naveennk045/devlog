Before we discussing RAG, we need to know why this framework comes into play,
what are problem it actually solves

Many LLMs are pre-trained, so the models are lacking at giving an accurate responses.
Accurate in the sense, they responses are factually incorrect, outdated information, irrelevant information, and lacking in domain specific knowledge

- Irrelevant response
- Hallucination
- Outdated Information
- Lack in domain specific knowledge

##### What is RAG

**RAG - Retrieval-Augmented Generation**
The name says everything, it is about how we feed the external data from multiple resources like databases, web-pages, APIs or document hubs to LLM to improve the performance and accuracy of the LLMs

##### Components of RAG

1. External Knowledge sources
2. Document processing phase or indexing
3. Embedding models
4. Vector database
5. Query encoder
6. Retriever
7. Prompt augmenting layer 
8. Generative layer
